- Fixed UnboundLocalError for 'total_usage' variable when opening new chats
- Added code execution to default TOOL_SEARCH_EXCLUDE_TOOLS list

v0.5.7

- Fixed a Bug in Tool Search return

v0.5.6
- Added Context Editing feature (clear_tool_uses, clear_thinking) with configurable strategies
- Added Tool Search feature (BM25/Regex) with deferred tool loading
- Status events for context clearing with token counts
- Warning notification for thinking+cache conflict

v0.5.5
- Fixed effort parameter support by upgrading Anthropic SDK from 0.60.0 to 0.75.0

v0.5.4
- Fixed Message Caching Problems when using RAG or Memories

v0.5.3
- Added Support for Anthropic Effort Levels (low, medium, high)
- Added Support for Opus 4.5
- Use correct logger for logging
- Removed DEBUG Valve
- Introduced UserValves for setting user-specific options like thinking, effort, web search limits and location

v0.5.2
- Fixed usage statistics accumulation for multi-step tool calls
- Correctly sums input and output tokens across all turns in a request

v0.5.1
- Fixed caching issue in tool execution loops where cache_control marker could be lost
- Optimized caching for multi-step tool calls by moving cache breakpoint to the latest tool result

v0.5.0
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Eliminated cross-talk between concurrent users/requests
- Removed shared instance state (self.eventemitter, self.request_id) that caused response mixing

v0.4.9
- Performance optimization: Moved local imports to top level
- Fixed fallback logic for model fetching when API fails

v0.4.8
- Added configurable MAX_TOOL_CALLS valve (default: 15, range: 1-50)
- Moved tool execution status events to content_block_start for immediate feedback (prevents stalling on long parameters)
- Added proactive warning to Claude when only 1 tool call remains before limit
- System message injected before final call to encourage text response instead of more tool calls
- Added user notifications when approaching limit (≤3 calls) and when limit is reached
- Improved event loop yielding with asyncio.sleep() for reliable status event delivery on heavy tool calls loads

v0.4.7
- Fixed potential data leakage between concurrent users
- Code cleanup and stability improvements

v0.4.6
- Tool results now display input parameters at the top
- Shows "Input:" section with tool parameters before "Output:" section
- Improves visibility of what parameters were passed to each tool call

v0.4.5
- Added status events for local tool execution (AIT-102)
- Tools now show "Executing tool: {tool_name}" when they start
- Tools show "Waiting for X tool(s) to complete..." during execution
- Tools show "Tool execution complete" when finished
- Improves UX for long-running tools - users now see activity instead of apparent hanging

v0.4.4
- Tool calls now execute in parallel and start immediately when detected
- Server tools (e.g., web_search) are no longer misidentified as local tools
- Web search now emits correct status events during execution
- Fixed final message chunk not being flushed in some streaming scenarios

v0.4.3
- Fixed compatibility with OpenWebUI "Chat with Notes" feature
- Added filtering for empty text content blocks to prevent API errors
- Messages with empty content arrays are now skipped (fixes empty assistant messages from Notes chat)

v0.4.2
- Fixed NoneType error in OpenWebUI Channels when models are mentioned (@model)
- Added safe event emitter wrapper to handle missing __event_emitter__ in channel contexts
- All status/notification/citation events now gracefully handle None event emitter

v0.4.1
- Added a Valve to Show Token Count in the final status message
- Auto-enable native function calling when tools are present (prevents OpenWebUI's function_calling task system)

v0.4.0
- Added Task Support (sorry, I forgot). Follow Ups, Titles and Tags are now generated.
- Fix "invalid_request_error ", when a response contains both, a server tool and a local tool use (eg. web search and a local tool).

v0.3.9
- Added fine grained cache control valve with 4 levels: disabled, tools only, tools + system prompt, tools + system prompt + user messages

v0.3.8
- Removed MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS valve - now always respects requested max_tokens up to model limit
- Simplified token calculation logic
- Reworked the caching with active Openwebui Memory System, Memories are now extracted from system prompt and injected into user messages as context blocks
- Refactored Model Info structure for maintainability
- Pipe is now retrying request on overloaded, rate_limit or transient errors up to MAX_RETRIES valve
- Status indicator is now shown while waiting for the first response (first response took very long when using eg. web_search tool)
- Removed unused aiohttp and random imports

v0.3.7
- Fixed Extended Thinking compatibility with Tool Use (API now requires thinking blocks before tool_use blocks)
- Added automatic placeholder thinking blocks when needed for API compliance
- Added validation for all assistant messages with tool_use when Extended Thinking is enabled

v0.3.6
- Added 4.5 Haiku Model
- Restructured Model Capabilities for more Maintainability

v0.3.5
- Fixed a bug where the last chunk was not sent in some cases
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added Correct Citation Handling for Web Search

v0.3.4
- Added Claude 4.5 Sonnet
- Small Bugfix with final_message
- Added OpenWebUI Token Usage Compatibility
- Added a Check for Duplicate Tool Names and private tool name (starting with "_") to avoid API errors

v0.3.3
- Fixed Tool Call error

v0.3.2
- Fixed type and added changelog

v0.3.1
- Fixed a bug where message would disappear after Error occurs

v0.3
- Added Vision support (__files__ handling & image processing improvements)
- Added Extended Thinking filter & metadata override with clamped budget logic (default 10K, safe min/max enforcement)
- Added Web Search Enforcement toggle (one‑shot metadata flag forces web_search tool_choice)
- Added Anthropic Code Execution Tool with toggle filter & beta header
- Enabled fine‑grained tool streaming beta by default
- Added metadata & valve controlled injection of code execution tool spec
- Improved cache control: auto‑disables cache when dynamic Memory / RAG blocks detected; ephemeral caching for stable blocks
- Refined tool_choice precedence (enforced web search before auto)
- Added 1M context optional beta header for supported Sonnet 4 models
- Improved malformed tool_use JSON salvage (_finalize_tool_buffer) & robust final chunk flush
- Misc debug output refinements & system prompt cleanup

v0.2
- Fixed caching by moving Memories to Messages instead of system prompt
- You can show Cache Usage Statistics with a Valve as Source Event
- Fixed error where last chunk is not shown in frontend
- Fixed defective event_emitters and removed unneeded method
- Fixed unnecessary requirements
- Implemented Web Search Valves and error handling
- Robust error handling
- Added Cache_Control for System_Prompt, Tools, and Message Array
- Refactored for readability and support for new models

        This method orchestrates the complete request lifecycle:
        
        PHASES:
        -------
        1. VALIDATION & SETUP (lines ~1650-1730)
           - API key validation
           - Task model detection and delegation
           - Native function calling auto-enablement
           
        2. PAYLOAD CREATION (lines ~1730-1760)
           - Create API payload and headers
           - Initialize streaming state variables
           
        3. STREAMING LOOP (lines ~1760-2600)
           - Event handling: message_start, content_block_start/delta/stop, message_delta/stop
           - Tool execution: parallel async tool calls
           - Citation handling for web search
           
        4. TOOL EXECUTION LOOP (lines ~2600-2800)
           - Collect tool results
           - Build assistant/user messages for continuation
           - Retry logic for API errors
           
        5. FINALIZATION (lines ~2800-2940)
           - Status updates with token counts
           - Completion events
        
        Note: StreamState dataclass (defined above) can be used for cleaner state management
        in future refactoring. Currently uses local variables for stability.
